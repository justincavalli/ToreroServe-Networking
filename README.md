# ToreroServe Server
This project is a web server named ToreroServe that serves pages from a directory we specify, using a port that we also specify. The server can be connected to from a web browser just like any other web server. It responds with the correct error messages you would expect from a typical web server and is able to handle multiple clients concurrently through C++ threads. Supported files it is able to service are as follows: HTML, CSS, JPEG, PNG, PDF, and plain text.
